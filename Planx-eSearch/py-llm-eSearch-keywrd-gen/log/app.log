2025-03-10 07:53:10,386 - config.llm_config - WARNING - No Python list format found in response: This appears to be a spam message from a YouTube seller offering various services such as:

* Buying YouTube subscribers and watch time
* Providing 4K watch time for Rs. 2400
* Selling 100 followers for Rs. 40, 100 likes for Rs. 5, 50 subscribers for Rs. 50, and 50 likes for Rs. 5 on TikTok
* Advertising their WhatsApp number (8899755394) for personal messages

The message is repetitive and includes multiple offers with varying prices. The seller claims to provide "permanent subscribers" and "original watch time" but does not provide any guarantees or assurances about the quality of these services.

It's worth noting that buying YouTube subscribers and watch time can be against YouTube's terms of service, and may result in penalties or account suspension if detected by the platform.

If you're interested in growing your YouTube channel, I'd recommend exploring organic methods such as creating high-quality content, engaging with your audience, and promoting your channel through social media and other online platforms.

2. **Swerve vs. Moxley**: The match between Swerve Strickland and MJF was replaced by one between Swerve and Jon Moxley.
3. **Christian Cage's cash-in**: Christian's attempt to cash in his contract for a title shot against MJF didn't work out, and he lost instead.
4. **Edge vs. Moxley**: Edge and Moxley had a match, but it was not the main event.
5. **Hangman Page's win**: Adam "Hangman" Page won the Owen Hart tournament, which you found surprising.
6. **Upcoming matches**: You're looking forward to individual match uploads and asked about the release date for 480p SD quality.

Some specific questions you asked:

* When will individual matches be uploaded?
* Can someone share a link to a John Moxley vs. Adam Copeland single match video (presumably referring to a match between Moxley and Edge, not Copeland)?
* Do you have any idea when the 480p SD version of AEW Revolution will be released?
* Were there any returns or debuts at the event?

Let me know if I've missed anything!

2025-03-10 07:55:42,256 - config.llm_config - WARNING - No Python list format found in response: It appears that you've shared a series of posts from the SafeMoon community on Solana, highlighting buy opportunities for SafeMoon (SFM) tokens. The posts are repetitive and contain similar information, including:

* The amount spent in SOL (Solana's cryptocurrency)
* The number of SFM tokens received
* A link to the buyer's account on Solscan.io
* A link to the transaction on Solscan.io
* An update on the market capitalization of SafeMoon

Here are some key points that can be extracted from these posts:

1. **Multiple buys:** There have been at least three separate buys made by the same buyer, with increasing amounts spent in SOL.
2. **Large SFM token purchases:** The buyer has acquired significant quantities of SFM tokens, including 32,305,845 and 38,230,533 tokens.
3. **Market capitalization update:** The market capitalization of SafeMoon is reported to be around $9 million.

However, without more context or information about the project's fundamentals, it's challenging to provide a neutral analysis or opinion on these buys. It's essential for investors to conduct their own research and due diligence before making investment decisions.

If you're interested in learning more about SafeMoon or would like me to analyze specific aspects of this project, please let me know!

1.  **Stake Your TOON:** Before you can order the card, ensure that your TOON is successfully staked. You can check this by visiting [Toon Pool Online](http://toonpool.online) and logging into your account.

2.  **Check Card Availability:** The message about there being "still 15 available" might be outdated or misleading. It's best to check the current availability on the Toon Pool website directly.

3.  **Ordering Process:** If you've completed staking, navigate to the card ordering section of the site. You should see an option to order a card if there are funds available in your account and you meet the requirements for the card.

4.  **Technical Support:** For more detailed assistance or troubleshooting, consider reaching out to Toon Pool's support team through their official channels (e.g., email, Discord, or Telegram groups dedicated to Toon). They can provide specific guidance tailored to your situation.

5.  **Community Forums or Groups:** If you're unable to find a solution through the official support channels, you might want to post about your issue in community forums or groups focused on Toon and Solana (e.g., [SOLTRENDING](https://t.me/SOLTRENDING) for trending updates). Other users who have encountered similar issues may offer valuable insights or solutions.

6.  **Update Your Browser:** Sometimes, browser issues can cause problems with website functionality. Try updating your browser to the latest version to see if that resolves any technical difficulties you're experiencing.

7.  **Contact Solana Support (if necessary):** If all else fails and you believe it's a broader issue related to Solana or the Toon protocol, you might need to reach out to Solana support directly for assistance.

1. **Song Titles**: The list appears to be a collection of Tamil song titles, possibly from old movies or popular songs. You can see that many of them have the phrase "Hey, My Name Is" followed by a name, which is likely a reference to a specific song.
2. **Movie Names**: There are some movie names listed as well, including "As the gods 2014". This might be an English title for a Tamil or Malayalam movie.

If you're looking for something specific, I'd be happy to help! What's on your mind?

2025-03-10 08:13:32,068 - config.llm_config - WARNING - No Python list format found in response: Из приведенного текста я могу сделать следующие выводы:

1. В первом разделе описываются услуги по подбору чатов для рекламных целей. Цены указаны в рублях и зависят от количества сообщений (10 000, 20 000, 50 000 или 100 000).
2. Второй раздел представляет собой предложение о работе на удаленную позицию. Требуются ответственные и честные люди для работы с базами чатов. Занятость на неполную ставку (2-4 часа), оплата обсуждается отдельно, выплаты производятся без задержек на банковскую карту.
3. В третьем разделе описываются услуги по рассылке рекламных сообщений в личные каналы Telegram. Предлагаются варианты рассылки: 100 сообщений за 400 рублей, 500 сообщений за 1600 рублей или 1000 сообщений за 2800 рублей.
4. В последнем разделе представляется предложение о работе на сортировочные склады в городе с зарплатой 80 000 рублей в месяц и 5/8 ATPAY (неясно, что это такое).

Общее впечатление от текста: предлагаются услуги по рекламным рассылкам и работа на удаленную позицию.

**Warning: Be cautious when clicking on links or providing personal information**

The text appears to be a movie request form, where the user is asking for specific movies to be added to their subscription list. Here's a breakdown of the content:

1. **Movie Request Form**: The text starts with a warning about being cautious when clicking on links or providing personal information.
2. **Example Movies**: The user has listed some example movies that they would like to watch, including:
	* Robin Hood (2010)
	* Kurup 2021
	* Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone
	* Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
3. **Movie Subscription Information**: The text mentions a subscription service called "NETFLIX PRIMIUM" with a one-year plan for ₹650/-. It's not clear what this service offers or how it compares to other streaming services.
4. **Request for Movies**: The user has listed some movies that they would like to watch, and there are two options:
	* [Delete Unused words Like Dubbed/Movies/Send/Hd , : - etc]
	* The other Zoey in Amazon prime NETFLIX PRIMIUM subscription

It seems that the user is requesting specific movies for their subscription service. However, I would advise you to be cautious when clicking on links or providing personal information.

If you could provide more context or clarify what you're trying to achieve with this text, I'd be happy to help further!

To clarify, it seems like there are multiple conversations happening at once. If you'd like to discuss something specific, feel free to start fresh and ask your question, and I'll do my best to assist you.

That being said, I did notice a few things:

* There's a mention of an Indian movie or show with the lyrics "I love the way, you love the chase, I'll make you say my name." Could you be thinking of a specific song or movie?
* Someone mentioned Bali and North Sumatra as tourist destinations in Indonesia. If you'd like more information on traveling in Indonesia, I'd be happy to help.
* There's also a mention of Waifu language, which seems to be a reference to Japanese culture. If you're interested in learning more about the language or culture, I can try to provide some resources.

Let me know if any of these topics interest you, or if there's something else on your mind that you'd like to discuss!

من المقرر أن يتم إصدار حدث "المنقذون 4.0" في النصف الثاني من عام 2025، وسيحتوي على بطلين هما "فيكسانا-سحر الليل" و "جوينيفير-الفجر المشرق". هذا الحدث سوف يكون له جودة ملحمي 3000 نقطة وسيحتاج إلى 2 مراحل من الموارد المميزة.

من الجيد أنك تتطلع إلى الاستمتاع بهذا الحدث، ولكن من الجيد أيضًا أن تعرف أن هناك بعض البطال الذين يمكنهم التأثير على رانكك بشكل كبير، مثل هانزوا أو جوي و سويو. إذا كنت ترغب في تحسين رانكك، قد يكون من المفيد أن تتعلم كيفية التعامل مع هذه الشخصيات.

هل لديك أي أسئلة أخرى حول هذا الحدث؟

The message also includes a mention of Naikke Bleksi, which seems to be a reference to a DJ or artist. There is also a mention of excited nya besok lagi, which translates to "excited for tomorrow again." 

The rest of the message appears to be a repetition of the same phrase in different languages and with various emojis. It's likely that this is some sort of automated response or a bot-generated message.

As for the streaming information, it seems that the user has started streaming music from an album called "Bernadya Full Album 2024".
